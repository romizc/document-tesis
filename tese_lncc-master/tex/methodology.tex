%Considering the production phase in a Predictive Serving System, the existing models already passed the training, testing and validating process, part of the Machine Learning Life Cycle \ref{chapter_Theoretical_Foundations}. These models maintain certain qualitative and quantitative metrics, to ensure their predictive performance they enter into a four-step cycle that is formed by techniques that continuously analyses these metrics. We are interested in process queries posed by users, 

% Work Objective 
In this work we propose a methodology focused on domain partitioning, that aims to reduce the computational workload and time that would be consumed if we were to train a model on each point of a spatio--temporal domain. We argue that, by considering a number of models generated over representative elements of the domain, which generalize the temporal dimension of other elements, it is possible to preserve a predictive quality comparable to the naive approach of using a model for every element. As a result of applying the proposed methodology, we could process a spatio--temporal predictive query effectively while maintaining a low error margin in the prediction.

% Describe the spatio-temporal domain considered (univariate time--series)
%Spatio--temporal domains are characterized by the we focus our work on problems which data are represented by univariate time--series the theoretical tools and methods considered in our methodology are the following time--series clustering, time--series classification and statistical methods for time--series forecasting.

% Methodology description
The process described by the methodology is divided in two phases, off-line and on-line. The off-line phase comprises three steps: (1) the domain partitioning process, based on clustering partition techniques to find representative elements; (2) the generation of predictive models for the representatives; and (3) a model composition process to predict a subset of the domain region.
%a knowledge extraction process for the underlying relationship between the representative models and domain characterization. 
The on-line phase consists of (4) a mechanism to compute a spatio--temporal predictive query. Figure \ref{Fig:OverviewMethodology} describes the methodology: the two main phases are represented in green, the steps for each phase in blue, the tasks performed in every step of the workflow in black and finally the corresponding expected products and outputs are shown in red.

In Sections \ref{Sec:DomainPartitioning} to \ref{Sec:SpatioTemporalQueryProcessing}, we detail the tasks performed in each step, describing the tools and methods used as well as techniques to validate their performance. The last section discusses the decisions adopted during the development of the methodology.

\section{Step 1: Domain Partitioning}
\label{Sec:DomainPartitioning}

% Objective and general description
The purpose of the domain partitioning is to i) find groups with high similarity according to the temporal evolution on a spatio--temporal domain (in particular univariate time--series) and ii) find representatives for each of the aforementioned groups. We adopt clustering techniques to partition the domain by grouping elements based on a shape similarity measure. In general, a clustering algorithm can be considered as an optimization problem in which we try to minimize the total measure of dissimilarity between the elements in each group \cite{Liao2005}.

% Consider a representative element
We consider two methods for grouping elements that involve obtaining a representative element (which also exists on the domain) for each group. A representative is then said to generalize the temporal dimension of the other elements in the group. It is important to remember that in a clustering algorithm, the number of clusters, the size of clusters, the definition for outliers, and the definition of the similarity among the univariate time--series are all the concepts which depend on the problem (case study) at hand \cite{Aghabozorgi2015}.
%The adjustment and parametrization of the whole clustering task is complex and subject to uncertainties. The similarity metric is then one of the first decisions to be made in order to establish how the distance between two independent vectors must be measured.

%TODO move DTW details to theoretical?
For univariate time--series data, several clustering techniques exist (See Section \ref{Sec:TimeSeriesClustering}). Since we are interested in leveraging the temporal behavior of the spatio--temporal domain, we adopt a shape--based similarity measure, i.e. we analyze the similarity of time--series based on the evolution of its shape over time. The similarity metric known as Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) \cite{Sakoe1978} is based on dynamic programming, it calculates an optimal match between two sequences of feature vectors by allowing for stretching and compression of sections of the sequences. 

% What are the products
As part of the off-line process we calculate the distance matrix that quantifies the DTW similarity between any two time series on the domain. This process can demand considerable computational power but it can be efficiently parallelized and it only needs to be executed once per domain dataset. 

%\subsection{Partition Profiles}
%TODO
% The objective is identify structures in an unlabelled dataset by objectively organizing data into similar groups.
% Clustering maximize similarity of elements intra groups, minimize similarity with objects in other groups.
% Justificar la decision de considerar dos tipos de particion del dominio: 
In this work we consider the following techniques for the domain partitioning:

\begin{itemize}%[noitemsep,nolistsep]		
	\item $k$--medoids clustering: the purpose of this technique is to group the domain elements that have a high degree of similarity. As mentioned before, we consider DTW as the similarity measure. This algorithm is a variation of the $k$--means algorithm and in contrast to this, $k$--medoids chooses existing objects within the domain instead of computed centroids. The benefits of using $k$--medoids as a clustering algorithm are two-fold. In addition to finding the groups that help minimize local dissimilarity, the algorithm returns a medoid for each group. For our methodology, we can leverage the model trained on each medoid and measure the generalization error of this model when applied to other points in the corresponding cluster. A downside of $k$--medoids approach is that it requires the computation of the distances between many points, which can have order of time complexity $O(n^2)$. To mitigate this problem, a matrix of distances between all points in a region is calculated and saved once. This distance matrix is then reused for all $k$--medoids clusters for that region, thereby significantly reducing the time to compute each $k$--medoids partitioning. \Fab{Talvez mere√ßa um experimento mostrando o beneficio da matriz.}
	
	\item Regular or naive partitioning: The spatio--temporal domain is first divided into $k$ rectangles of the same shape (allowing for irregularities when the dimensions cannot be exactly divided) and then, for each given group, we find the element (centroid) that minimizes the total sum of DTW distances to that element. This partitioning is used as a baseline in our methodology to better assess the adequacy of $k$--medoids. This partitioning has no parameters besides the desired number of groups.
\end{itemize}

% Representation of partition profile using the problem formalization
Considering our formal representation in Section \ref{Sec:ProblemFormalization}, we can express the domain partitioning for the spatio--temporal domain $\mathcal{D}$ as follows:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{D} = \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} \mathbf{S}_{i},
\end{equation}
where for any $i\neq j$ we have that $\mathbf{S}_{i} \cap \mathbf{S}_{j} = \emptyset$, due to the crisp clustering algorithm. And for $\mathbf{S}_{i}$, we admit that a $\mathcal{S}_{i}^{*} \in \mathbf{S}_{i}$ exists (the representative of the group) such that generalizes the temporal dependence of all the elements in $\mathbf{S}_{i}$. 

% Proceso de evaluacion de tipos de particion
% 1. Comparacion de sumas costo total de distancias de sus elementos al representante
% 2. Variabilidad de elementos intracluster
% Consecuencia de 2: Dados elementos aleatorios cual de los dos tipos de particion representa mejor cada elemento
Then we validate the performance of a time series clustering method, i.e. evaluate the goodness of clustering results. This has been recognized as one of the vital issues essential to the success of clustering applications \cite{Aggarwal2013}. Unfortunately, despite the vast amount of expert efforts spent on this issue, there is no consistent and conclusive solution to cluster validation. 

\subsection{Determining the number of groups}
\label{sub:domain_number_groups}

The performance of the $k$--Medoids algorithm is dependent on the optimal value of $k$, the number of clusters to be generated. The $k$--medoids algorithm requires the user to specify the value of $k$, and finding a suitable value automatically is very challenging for time-series data set. The choice is often ambiguous, with interpretations depending on the shape and scale of the distribution of the time--series in a dataset \cite{Liao2005}. An optimal choice of $k$ should strike a balance between maximizing the compression of the data using a single cluster, while maximizing the accuracy when assigning each data point to its own cluster. Here, we explore some of the available methods for finding a suitable value for $k$.


When using a clustering technique for high volumes of data and low variability of the data values throughout neighbor points, it is difficult to determine the optimal number of groups ($k$). This is particularly important for our problem, where there is low variation in the spatial data distribution of the different time-series. 
To identify a cluster in a dataset, we try to minimize the distance between points in a cluster, and the Within-Sum-of-Squares (WSS) method, also know as the Elbow method, measures exactly that. The WSS score is the sum of the squares of the distances of all points within a cluster. Given that the WSS score converges towards zero as the number of groups $k$ goes up to the number of points in the dataset, this method aims to choose a small value of $k$ that still has a low SSE. This is achieved by finding the maximum numerical second derivative for each point, using its two neighboring points (we take into account that the $k$ values are not equidistant when calculating the numerical second derivative). In practice, the elbow represents a point beyond which there are diminishing returns by increasing $k$ \cite{Han2011}.

The average silhouette is another method that assesses the quality of a clustering, by measuring how similar a member is to its own group compared to other groups. The silhouette index is a way to measure how close each point in a cluster is to the points in its neighboring clusters. %We expect to find the optimum value for $k$ during $k$-means clustering.
Silhouette values lies in the range of $[-1, 1]$. A value close to $+1$ indicates that the sample is far away from its neighboring cluster and very close to the cluster to which it is assigned, meaning it is `well-clustered'. In contrast, a value of $-1$ indicates that the sample is closer to a neighboring cluster than to the cluster to which it is assigned, meaning that it is `misclassified'. A value of $0$ means that it is not clear to which cluster the point should be assigned. %Value of $+1$ is ideal and $-1$ is least preferred. Hence, higher the value better is the cluster configuration \cite{Rousseeuw1987}.

In this work we also consider a more refined procedure to find an optimal value for $k$ by means of the inflection point (zero second derivative). But before calculating the second derivative, we apply a cubic smoothing spline to interpolate the values, to reduce the noise in the WSS scores. Splines are a smooth and flexible way of fitting Non linear Models and learning the Non linear interactions from the data. This approach will give us another suitable value for $k$.
%In this case, techniques to determine a suitable value for $k$, such as the Elbow Method, may not present convergence to a local minimum for the total cost of dissimilarity for a specific $k$. 

Comparing partitions approaches, either with each other or with data, is a common requirement in cluster validation. For example, one might hope that different sub-samples of the same data set, or different methods applied to the data, would give similar results. This can also be considered as an aspect of robustness.

% Comparison of the total sum 
We compare these domain partitioning techniques against each other to assess the robustness of the $k$--medoids clustering over the regular partitioning. Since we try to optimize the cost function for $k$--medoids, we argue that for larger values of $k$ the cost function for both partition techniques present a significant difference between them. %TODO argumento? hipotesis? sera mostrado? 

%The outputs of the process adopted for the domain characterization are the DTW matrix for the dataset considered and a set of representative elements for each group. 

In the next Section we describe the methods adopted to built a predictive model for the representative element for every group.

%From the computational point of view, although DTW distance is of order $\mathcal{O}$

\section{Step 2: Identifying Models for Representatives}
\label{Sec:ModelRepresentatives}

% Summary: Consider a predictive model generated over representatives of the spatio--temporal domain, we consider that some representatives can be more suitable than others for a particular element in the domain. We want to analyze the generalization error obtained when using the model of a representative to compute a forecast for the time series in another element. 
The main objective in this step is to generate predictive models for the representative elements in a domain partitioning; using these models we have the ability to compose and/or select those that correspond to a region of interest. %TODO Verify the validity of the NFT for time series forecast methods

We generate predictive models when we apply a forecast method over a time-series in a spatio-temporal domain. In this work, we consider the following forecast methods: Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and $k$--Nearest Neighbor ($k$NN) models. Working with ARIMA model can offer a good trade-off between the predictive accuracy and computational resources to train and predict. The simpler $k$--Nearest Neighbor model is used as a baseline for comparing predictive accuracy.   

% Generalization Error and Forecast
In practice, two aspects to forecasting exist: the provision of a forecast for a future value (out-of-sample) of the series and the provision of a forecast error of known values of the series (in-sample). After the process of model tuning, it is possible to test the ability of the model to predict observations that the model didn't see before (as opposed to the fitted values that the model saw throughout the training process). %The most common method for evaluating the success of the forecast in order to predict the actual values is to use accuracy or error metrics.
The most common method for evaluating the forecast's success is to predict the actual values with the use of an error metric to quantify the forecast's overall accuracy \cite{Hyndman2006}. The selection of a specific error metric depends on the forecast accuracy's goals. In this work we consider the following two:

%TODO is this only for in-sample?
\begin{itemize}
	\item Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): This is the root of the average squared distance of the actual and forecasted values:
	\begin{equation}
	RMSE = \sqrt{MSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^{n} \left(\mathcal{S}_{t} - \mathcal{\hat{S}}_t\right)^{2}}
	\end{equation}
	Like MSE, the RMSE has a large error rate due to the squared effect and is therefore sensitive to outliers.
	\item Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): This measures the average percentage
	absolute error:
	\begin{equation}
	MAPE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^{n} \left|\frac{\mathcal{S}_{t} - \mathcal{\hat{S}}_{t}}{\mathcal{S}_{t}}\right|
	\end{equation}
\end{itemize}

% Refresh the notation
Recalling the formal representation in Section \ref{Sec:ProblemFormalization}, once we obtain the representative element $\mathcal{S}^{*} \in \mathbf{S}_{i}$, we built $g:\mathbf{S}_{i} \to \mathbf{S}_{i}$ and we can represent $\mathbf{S}_{i}$ using $\mathcal{S}^{*}$ we denote:

%TODO error should have been defined before introducing this equation in formalization
%TODO try to elaborate on the expression of E after explaining forecastings, e.g. f(St - S^t)
\begin{equation}
g^{*}_{i} = \langle \mathcal{S}^{*}, A_p, \mathbf{p}, E, \varSigma \rangle
\end{equation}

%TODO improve this
Thus, the initial approach of having a generic set of models for a domain has been refined, there can now be a reduced number of predictive models that depends on the number of representatives considered. In the case of using a single domain partitioning scheme with $k$ partitions to characterize a domain, there will be $k$ instances of a particular model with $\langle A, p \rangle$ properties. 

%In this step, for a domain partitioning we obtain their corresponding predictors for each representative. As a result, we reduce the number of predictive models generated for a spatio--temporal domain. 
As an implementation detail of the off--line process, the predictive models are saved to persistent storage with the appropriate metadata (domain, similarity measure, domain partitioning scheme, group index). This will allow us to recover previously generated predictive models when computing a forecast value for a time-series. The result of applying a partitioning technique to a domain is also stored to speed up future computations.

\section{Step 3: Selecting a Model Representative}
\label{Sec:KnowledgExtraction}

For a given domain partitioning technique and its predictive models for the representatives, we define a ``model composition'' as the sub-set of representative models that has the ability to compute the prediction/forecast value of the elements in a region of interest on the domain. 
%According to the formal representation adopted in Section \ref{Sec:ProblemFormalization}, for $k$ we can consider a model composition $\mathcal{G'} \subset \mathcal{G}$ such that:
%\begin{equation}
%\mathcal{G'} = \left\{ g^{*}_{i}, \,\, \textrm{for} \,\, 1\leq i \leq k \right\},
%\end{equation}
%TODO what does $\mathbb{R}$ represent here?  
%and we represent the solver $\mathcal{A}$, as the relation between the pair $(R, \mathcal{G'})$ and $\mathbb{R}$, where $R$ is the region of interest on the spatio--temporal domain. 
The model composition computes the RMSE of the forecast error $E_{g^{*}}$ calculated by the models in the intersection $R \cap \bigcup_{i=1}^{k} \mathbf{S}_{i}$ on each element of $R$.  In the following figure we represent the model composition for the region considering the medoid:
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{../Figures/ModelCompositionRegion}
	\caption{Model Composition using the Representative for a Region $\mathbf{S_{i}}$.}
	\label{Fig:ModelRegion}
\end{figure}
% over the representative elements on each partition profile. 
% We have the capability of store multiple partition profiles, each solver will present different forecast error (and generalization bounds) for the elements in the spatio--temporal domain.  

% Solver forecast error analysis
In order to assess the predictive quality of model for the representative element in a given domain partitioning  technique, we compare the generalization error of three other model compositions, in addition to the composition that uses predictive model at the representatives. The four model compositions are described as follows: % applied to each group of a partition profile the following characteristics:

\begin{itemize}%[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item Model Composition with Minimal Error: for each group, we find the time series for which its predictive model, when applied to all points of its corresponding group, minimizes the accumulated forecast error. This can be considered the `best' choice for representatives that can only be found through an exhaustive approach.
	\item Model Composition with Minimal Local Error: for each time series $ts_j$ in each group, we train its own model $g_j$ and calculate the corresponding forecast error. We can say that this would be the forecast error of a naive approach, because it generates as many models as there are time series in the region. This approach should offer the least accumulated forecast error but at a high computational cost, and is the scenario we want to improve on with our methodology.
	\item Model Composition at the Medoids: given the time series of the representatives in each group, we find the corresponding model for each representative, and use it to predict future values of the other time series in their corresponding groups. We then calculate, for each group, the accumulated forecast error when using the model in the representative for all elements in the group. This corresponds to the proposed methodology, and its forecast estimate and generalization error will be evaluated experimentally.
	\item Model Composition with Maximum Error: for each group, we find the time series for which its predictive model, when applied to all poins of its corresponding group, maximizes the accumulated forecast error. This can be considered the `worst' choice for representatives. Together with the Minimal Error, it provides an interval that helps to quantify the appropriateness of the choice of representatives when using the Model Composition at the Medoids.
\end{itemize}
% TODO 

% Why we analyze this forecast error
% Analyze the Forecast Error For the Intra-Cluster Elements
% We argue that using the solver comprised by the predictor medoid give us a good estimate of the forecast error, and it is sufficient to evaluate all the elements in its group. 

%At the same time, by considering the model trained on the medoid for each group as the forecast method to be applied over each element, we want to analyze if a correlation between the intra-cluster distance to the medoid and the forecast error exists, which will give us the behavior of the generalization bounds for the predictor over the elements similar to them.

%Analyze the Forecast Error for the Representative Elements
%TODO Describe products
As discussed in the previous Section, in our problem we are not considering a unique $k$ to analyze our methodology, because there is no specific way to optimize the value of $k$. In the following Section we describe the process of building a model composition that is able to leverage several given domain partitioning.

\subsection{Preparing a Classifier for Representative Models}
\label{Sec:Classifier}
In the next two sections, we seek to implement a process that is able to select predictive models using some kind of intelligence, with the aim of finding a composition of models to predict a region of interest with increased accuracy. Here, it is  necessary to recall that, when computing the future value of a variable for a time series, we have to consider a range of values in the immediate past. Thus, in order to create a process for selecting models, we need a mechanism that allows us to find and use relationships between the set of representatives and past temporal instances of every element in the region of interest. 

We formulate this step as a univariate time series multi-class classification problem: Given an unlabeled univariate time series, assign it to one or more predefined classes. For our problem the classes are defined by the identifier of a predictive model on the representative, label composed with the value $k$ and the group index \texttt{cluster\_index} (c.i) where $0 \leq c.i <k$. 

%For example, in Figure \ref{Fig:ModelComposition}, we represent graphically the model composition to predict the region $R$ in a regular partitioning.

%\end{figure}

%TODO Mejorar esta descripcion
% Basicamente tengo tres perfiles de particion de tamanhos m, n y l
%We start the automatic selection for representative models process by considering more than partition profile. The justification for this is that different partition profiles may offer representatives for which their forecast produces smaller forecast errors, but the most suitable representatives are not tied to any particular partition profile (the intra-cluster distance is minimized to find representatives, not the forecast error).

In order to show how we can leverage domain partitioning schemes and their respective representatives, we use the formal representation of the problem (see Section \ref{Sec:ProblemFormalization}), with three different domain partitioning schemes as an example: Given three domain partitioning schemes for a spatio--temporal domain of sizes $m, n$ and $l$ and their respective representative sets, we have:
\begin{eqnarray} 
\nonumber
\mathcal{D}	& = & \bigcup_{i=1}^{m} \mathbf{P_i} \,\,\textrm{and} \,\, \left\{\mathcal{P}_{1}^{m}, \ldots, \mathcal{P}_{m}^{m}\right\},  \\ \nonumber
\mathcal{D} & = & \bigcup_{j=1}^{n} \mathbf{Q_j} \,\,\textrm{and} \,\, \left\{\mathcal{Q}_{1}^{n}, \ldots, \mathcal{Q}_{n}^{n}\right\}, \\ \nonumber 
\mathcal{D} & = & \bigcup_{k=1}^{l} \mathbf{T_k} \,\,\textrm{and} \,\, \left\{\mathcal{T}_{1}^{l}, \ldots, \mathcal{T}_{l}^{l}\right\},
\end{eqnarray}
%TODO:change notation for the predictors on representatives.
where $m + n +l < \textrm{card}(\mathcal{D})$. The set of representatives on the partitioning schemes considered is $\mathbf{R} = \left\{\mathcal{P}_{i}^{m}, \ldots, \mathcal{P}_{m}^{m}, \mathcal{Q}_{1}^{n}, \ldots, \mathcal{Q}_{n}^{n}, \mathcal{T}_{1}^{l}, \ldots \mathcal{T}_{l}^{l} \right\}$ , and $\mathcal{G}_{(\mathbf{R})}$ is the set or their correspondent models. Now, for each element in the domain, we want to find some representative $\mathcal{S} \in \mathbf{R}$ that is the representative of some group in a partitioning scheme $\mathbf{P}$, so that the representative satisfies some optimization condition. Here, we choose the representative $\hat{S}$ whose model $g_{\mathcal{\hat{S}}} \in \mathcal{G}_{(\mathbf{R})}$ has the minimum forecast error for the corresponding time series among the other models:

%among th For the relationship between elements of the domain and representatives we build the following dataset, consider any $\mathcal{S} \in \mathcal{D}$ such that we can find a representative element in $\mathbf{R}$ whose predictor has the minimum forecast error:
%TODO describir en texto lo que se esta minimizando

\end{equation}
% Find the label for any time--series
% TODO seed para el label?
\Fab{na Eq. 4.5, $S^^ \in R$ ja aparece na antecedente da formula.}
In order to simplify the notation of the aforementioned relationship (\ref{eq:timeseries-representative}), we denote the model with a label \texttt{[number\_of\_clusters, cluster\_index]}, that corresponds to the representative label of the partitioning schemes considered. Assuming that only the number of clusters is used as a parameter for partitioning schemes, this label can uniquely identify each of the representative models, so we can extract a dataset similar to Table \ref{Tab:TSClassificationDataset}. %Then the extracted dataset is represented by:

\subsection{Training a Classifier for Representative Models}
\label{Sec:TrainingClassifier}
% Idea of Classifier
For the second part of the model selection process, we are interested in implementing a mechanism based on the knowledge acquired on an extracted dataset (Table \ref{Tab:TSClassificationDataset}). The objective is, given a previously unseen time-series, infer a suitable label (and thus a predictive model on a representative) for it by recognizing patterns in the time-series. This can be formulated as a time--series classification problem, which consists of training a classifier on a dataset $TSD$ in order to map from the space of possible inputs to a probability distribution over the class variable values (labels). 

%TODO cita con idea general de classifier, one-hot encoding, etc
With the proposed classification method, we will be able to learn from data about the membership relation between elements of the domain and representatives, and then use this learned knowledge to classify new time-series. A dataset $TSD=\{(\mathcal{S}_1,y_1),(\mathcal{S}_2,y_2), \ldots ,(\mathcal{S}_N,y_N)\}$ is a collection of pairs $(\mathcal{S}_i,y_i)$ where $\mathcal{S}_i$ is univariate time series with $y_i$ as its corresponding one-hot label vector of the labels. For a dataset containing $m+n+l$ classes, the one-hot label vector $y_i$ is a vector of length $m+n+l$ where each element $j \in [1,(m+n+l)]$ is equal to 1 if the class of $X_i$ is $j$ and $0$ otherwise \cite{Mitsa2010}.

%Multiclass classifier
The task of time-series classification is not a simple one, considering the sequential aspect of time-series data requires the development of algorithms that are able to harness this temporal property select a class label from among a collection of candidates. While many neural network (NN) architectures can be used to solve this problem, some work better than others. 

In this work we use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), they typically fare very well on multiclass classification tasks, especially for images and text \cite{Fawaz2019}. The powerful learning ability of deep CNN is primarily due to the use of multiple feature extraction stages that can automatically learn representations from the data. Research has shown that using CNNs for time series classification has several important advantages over other methods; they are highly noise-resistant models, and they are able to extract very informative, deep features, which are independent from time \cite{Sainath2015}.

%https://monkcage.github.io/blog/ai/2019/01/28/time_series_forecast.html
%CNN-LSTM for Time Series Classification
Another architecture are the Long-Short Term Memory Neural Networks, the benefit of this model is that the model can support very long input sequences. By implementing an hybrid CNN-LSTM Neural Network, we are able to integrate the capacity of process time-series as blocks or sub-sequences by the CNN model, then pieced together by the LSTM model. Then the model will further divide each sample into further sub-sequences. The CNN model will interpret each sub-sequence and the LSTM will piece together the interpretations form the sub-sequences. 

%TODO picture or example to show how CNN and LSTM work together...
\section{Step 4: Spatio--Temporal Predictive Query Processing}
\label{Sec:SpatioTemporalQueryProcessing}	

% $R = \langle R, t_p, t_f, Q_{m} \rangle$
In this Section we describe the on--line process implemented to compute a spatio--temporal predictive query, denoted in Equation \ref{eq:predictivequery}, (see Section \ref{Sec:ProblemFormalization}). We consider the following workflow in Figure \ref{Fig:OnLineQP}: 

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{../Figures/Query_Processing}
	\caption{On-Line Processing Spatio-Temporal Predictive Query}
	\label{Fig:OnLineQP}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item [(a)] The input query is processed to extract the query region $R$ and the number of steps $t_p$ and $t_f$.
    \item [(b)] A data validation and extraction from the original dataset are performed according to the input parameters. The data processing for the query consists of the extraction of instances for the query region $R$ joint with past time units $t_{p}$, this means that for each point in $R$ exists a univariate time--series with $t_{p}$ values.
    \item [(c)] When processing a spatio-temporal predictive query, initially we need to determine, for each point in the query region, which predictive models will be used. The model composition is then the resulting set of predictive models used to answer the predictive query with a forecast over the region of interest $R$. %for every element in the query region in order to compose the set of predictive models to compute a forecast for each element on the query region.
    Here we implement three types of model composition for analysis:

   \begin{itemize}

	\item Composition of Point Predictive Models: For every point in the region of interest $R$ we use a naive approach to train a predictive model on each point. This is based on the Model Composition with Minimal Local Error described in Section \ref{Sec:KnowledgExtraction}, but limited to the subset region $R$. To compute the forecast and associated forecast error, we simply use the model on each point.

	\item Composition of Representative Predictive Models: This approach uses the stored information corresponding to the domain partitioning schemes and their respective models. In this type of composition, we require that a domain partitioning scheme (size $k$) is specified as input of the query. Then, we identify the representatives for every point in the query region to load the predictive models that have been previously trained at the representatives. For each point in $R$, the model associated to its representative will be used to compute the forecast and associated forecast error.
	
	\item Composition of Classifier for Predictive Models: A solver that calculates the result of a prediction query using the outcome of an external classifier (e.g. Neural Network). The classifier is a function that, given an input series of size $t_p$, a predetermined suite of partitioning schemes and a region, returns one of the representatives from any of the partitioning schemes that are available in the suite. Once the representative is determined, we follow a similar procedure as the previous model composition, also using the stored information from the domain partitioning scheme and their respective models. This is the main model composition that we wish to evaluate, while the other two are presented for comparisons.
%\Fab{I think query processing involves, in addition to Model Selection: input data preparation; model evaluation; results composition. }
%	Using the model generated at Step 3 (Knowledge Extraction), we apply this model to the $t_p$ time units of every point in the query region to infer the label for a corresponding predictor. Similar to the Representative Predictor composition, the corresponding predictors are loaded and the forecast computed in every point.

   \end{itemize}
    \item [(d)] With the predictive models obtained from one of the model compositions of the previous step, the requested forecast for the $t_{f}$ steps for each point in $R$ is computed. 
    
    Additionally, if there is information available regarding the actual values of the predictive variable matching the forecast interval, the corresponding error is computed. Otherwise, the generalization error of the model is used. Finally, the errors of the points in $R$ are combined using MSE to produce a single scalar metric for the prediction error over $R$.
\end{itemize}

%(i) with the information provided by $R$ and $t_{p}$, a data validation and extraction from the original dataset are performed; (ii) the model composition is then carried out; (iii) finally the requested forecast for the $t_{f}$ steps for each element in $R$ is computed. 


%%TODO ?? ese es el task? o es la forma como se desea resolver el task
%The task of spatio--temporal predictive query processing for a query $Q = \langle R, t_p, t_f, Q_{m} \rangle$, consists of recognizing for every time-serie in $R$ which is its correspondent predictor. Basically, a mechanism ``on-line'' that execute the model generated in the previous step.
% 
%In this step we can formalize the process of knowledge extraction as follows: For a spatio--temporal domain characterization $\mathcal{D} = \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} \mathbf{S_i}$, it is possible to find an element $\mathcal{\hat{S}} \in \mathbf{S_i}$ such that $g(\mathcal{\hat{S}})$ accounts for the generalization error bounds of the models for all the elements in $\mathbf{S_i}$. Given $Q = \langle R, tp, tf, Q_{m} \rangle$:
%\begin{align*}
%\forall \,\, \mathcal{S} \in R: \,\,\exists \,\, \mathcal{\hat{S}} \in \,\, \left( \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} \mathbf{S_i} \right) \,\, \textrm{such that} \,\, \mathcal{S} \sim \mathcal{\hat{S}} \,\,\textrm{and} \,\, \argminA_{\mathcal{S}\in R, \,\mathcal{\hat{S}} \in \mathbf{S}_{i}} E (g_{\mathcal{\hat{S}}}(\mathcal{S})) 
%\end{align*}
%
%The final query value computed is the RMSE of all the predictions on the elements in $R$.
