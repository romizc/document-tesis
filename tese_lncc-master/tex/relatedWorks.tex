In the previous chapter we described the context and purpose of this work, the proposal of a methodology to process spatio--temporal predictive queries in a spatio--temporal domain with massive data (represented by univariate time series). This methodology considers the use of various techniques and algorithms for this type of data, we can consider three clear objectives: cluster, classify and predict the data trend. 

This chapter thus reviews related studies, by presenting current efforts of efficient techniques for time-series clustering and classification. Also, we review works for prediction methods in particular those focused on the temporal modeling for spatio-temporal domain. We conclude by discussing works on methods for predictive models and

\section{Time-Series Clustering and Classification}
\label{Sec:ClusteringRelatedWorks}

% Time series clustering basics review 
During several decades the data mining community focused on time-series data (univariate and multivariate) clustering, which is a solution for classifying enormous data when there is not any early knowledge about classes. Were developed algorithms, criteria for evaluating the performance of the clustering results, and the measures to determine the similarity/dissimilarity between two time series being compared, either in the forms of raw data, extracted features, or some model parameters \cite{Liao2005, Aghabozorgi2015}.

In accordance with the purpose of grouping the data, it is necessary to consider two characteristics for the partitioning method, [density- hierarchical-etc] and the similarity measure to compare the time series. Traditionally, the Euclidean distance is used to measure the , but for time series the focus is on the similarity of shape between them. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) was originally used for speech re cognition and later introduced to other sequential data for similarity measurement. DTW has long been accepted as a good and efficient similarity measure for time series data \cite{}.

% Time Series Classification
Classification is a traditional data mining task. For the univariate time series domain, special treatment must be considered due to the nature of the data. Geurts (2001) proposes to classify time series data based on combining local properties or patterns in the time series. Zhang et al. (2004) develop a representation method using wavelet decomposition that can automatically select the parameters for the classification task. They propose a nearest neighbor classification algorithm, using the derived appropriate scale. Kadous and Sammut (2005) use metafeature approach (i.e. recurring substructure) like local maxima in time series to generate classifiers. Similarly, Yang et al. (2005) focus on feature subset selection (FSS) based on common principal components, which is called CleVer, to retain the correlation information among original features. Classification is employed to evaluate the effectiveness of the selected subset of features.

In several domains, including climate science, neuroscience, social sciences, epidemiology, transportation, criminology, and Earth sciences, space and time are the main characteristic to consider in its observational data in the form of time--series. These aspects along with the technical advantages of nowadays, allow to domain specialists collect a vast amounts of data in order to analyze and study certain phenomenon with great detail \cite{}.

\section{Methods for Executing Spatio--Temporal Predictive Queries}
\label{Sec:RelatedWorksQueries}

A predictive spatio-temporal query, in particular a predictive range query has a query region $R$ and a time $t$, and asks about the predictions expected to be inside $R$ after time $t$ based on historical data (or previous knowledge).  In \cite{Akdere2011} the authors discusses the integration or extension of a RDBMS with a predictive component able to support data-driven predictive analytics. A predictive query and spatio-temporal predictive query, is defined as a traditional query using a declarative language that also has a predictive capability \cite{Hendawi2012}. 

They common uses for predictive queries: the support for predictive analytics to answer complex questions involving missing or future values, correlations, and trends, which  can be used to identify opportunities or threats
The predictive functionality can help build introspective services that assist in various data and resource management and optimization tasks (off-line or on-line predictive techniques). 
The  scope  of  this  production requires  more  efficient  querying development to  retrieve more accurate  information (better results)  within  the  shortest time  frame.

\section{Discussion}
Time-Series Classification is a difficult task and the traditional ML techniques have limitations due to the time dependency in the observations. Exists traditional approaches using sequential models like LSTM or RNN, but recent studies shows that the use of Deep Learning models are good options to obtain a decent performance and accuracy \cite{Fawaz2019}.
